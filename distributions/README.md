# Distributions

The current directory contains information, resources and examples about the distributions of the
`Ontotext Reconciliation`.

All required components for the service are available as `Docker Images`, which allows to define few distribution
options like `docker-compose` and `Helm Chart`.

There are corresponding directories for each of the options, where you can find description on how to setup an
environment and all of the required resources to do that.
